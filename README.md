# Breakout

## What is the project about?
This project is about advancing my personal learning with OpenGL and Game Development. Instead of using a pre-made engine, I decided to develop a game using OpenGL and a couple of libraries.
This way I can improve my programming and development skills by what is going under the hood and take that knowledge with me when using other engines like Unity, Godot or Unreal Engine.

### Main Focus of Projects
- Apply Computer Graphics knowledge into a small game
- Ulitize OpenGL for experience with Graphics API
- Improve Game Development and Project Skills such as Planning, Code Organization, Version Control, and CMake Build

### Tech Stack used:
- Build System: CMake
- Window and Input: GLFW
- Math Library: GLM
- Image Loading: stbi
- Language: C/C++
- VCS: Git/GitHub
