# Breakout

## What is the project about?
This project is about advancing my personal learning with OpenGL and Game Development. Instead of using a pre-made engine, I decided to develop a game using OpenGL and a couple of libraries.
This way I can improve my programming and development skills by what is going under the hood and take that knowledge with me when using other engines like Godot or Unreal Engine.

### Main Focus of Projects
- Apply Computer Graphics knowledge into a small game
- Ulitize OpenGL for experience with Graphics API
- Improve Game Development and Project Skills such as Planning, Code Organization, Version Control, and CMake
